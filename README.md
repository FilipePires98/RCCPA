## Description 

The aim of this project is to explore the capabilities of Android Studio to quickly develop mobile applications for a given purpose.
The chosen context is the creation of an app that allows the user to remotely control his/her connected car in order to:
- locate it
- lock/unlock the doors/trunk
- activate the air conditioner and define its temperature
- honk or activate the lights
- check its status (temperature, warnings, ...)

Although it is not meant to be used in a real-case scenario, the developed application passed the initial implementation phases, including a user evaluation executed in order to seek further improvement windows.
Final considerations for future work are also provided.

## Repository Structure

/design - contains all of the designs created for the application (icons, logo, car model)

/docs - contains all documentation (presentations, prototype, reports and user evaluation results)

/src - contains the application's source code
